# Java-Graph-ADT

This is a dummy map that allows one to plot geographical data (latittude,longitude and routes) using UTM. 
This project is created to show the application of [Graph Data Structure](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-a-graph-data-structure) while it also use [UTM coordinate system formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system) 
for converting Latitude & Longitude to (x,y) coordinate system and to calculate accurate distance from two points.
